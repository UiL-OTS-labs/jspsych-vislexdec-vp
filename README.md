Visual [Lexical Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_decision_task) Experiment with _Visual Prime_ (template)

# Generic template documentation
Please read the [generic documentation](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-uil-template-docs) for context and scope.

# Task Description
The participant first sees a fixation cross, then a prime is presented, followed by the test stimulus. Particpants are instructed to respond as quickly as possible to make the decision if both strings in the pair are words --or not--, using the keyboard.

- The _prime_ is a string of letters and can be a _real word_ or a _nonword_.
- The _'test stimulus'_ is a string of letters and can also be a _real word_ or a _nonword_.

## Longer description
There are many (slightly) different variations of a lexical decision task. 

In this version, a trial consists of subsequently presenting _two_ words or nonwords. The participant needs to make a swift decision whether the _pair_ of presented sets of letters - the test stimuli - are _both_ acutal words or not. 

The essential sub trial phases for _one_ trial for this boilerplate experiment are:

1. Fixation cross presentation (fixed time, no responses are recorded) 
2. Prime presentation (fixed time, no responses are recorded)
3. Test stimulus presentation (the last string of letters of the presented pair, lexical decision phase). 

Only in this _last phase_ (the decision phase), as soon as the item is being presented, the participant can respond with the keyboard.

## Output
The data of _all_ (sub) _trial phases_ are logged in the data, but the output data can be filtered after data collection in many ways.
Please read the [general primer on jsPsych's data](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-output) if you are new to jsPsych data output.

Essential output for the _'true experimental'_ purpose in this template are:

- Reaction Time (RT) of the keyboard response in the decision phase
- Correctness of the keyboard response in the decision phase

The crucial trial/sub-trial phase (decision phase) output may look similar to this:

# Getting started 
People _affiliated to our lab__ can use the information [from our lab webiste](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/experiments/overview/) and expand the "Online experiments using jsPsych" section for details. Please follow [this how-to](https://uilots-labs.wp.hum.uu.nl/how-to/online-experimenting/).

### Make your experiment ready for use with the data server

### Update access key
In the file `globals.js` is a variable:
```javascript
const ACCESS_KEY = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
```
Before uploading your experimentto the UiL-OTS data server, you will need to change this to the access_key that you obtained when your experiment was approved. For elaborate info see `globals.js`.


### Adapting stimuli
- Open the file `stimuli.js` in your plain text editor.
- There is a list, called LIST_1:

```javacript
const LIST_1 = [ // stimuli and timeline variables

```
-  This list can be adapted to your own needs, i.e, you can replace values, make the list longer (don't forget to increment the 'id' values for new items!).
- If you need to implement a more complex design, you should read the `stimuli.js` file (and its comment sections) a little better. 
- For an example of a Latin square design, please have a look [here](https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-spr-mw).
